   * What we are doing:
   * Each tetra is represented by four 3D triangles. The only
   * quick way of finding if another tetra is within the other
   * tetra is to see if a single vertex is within the triangles
   * of the other tetra. So, for example, a tetra is represented
   * by points B, C, D and E with triangles BCD, BCE, DCE and BDE.
   * There is another tetra with a vertex A which was detected for
   * collision by the broadphase. Now, if the point A is between ALL
   * triangles of the other tetra (BCD, BCE, etc.) then the collision
   * is valid and we can pass point A to the manifold. Since the only
   * points on the tetra are the 4 vertices, collision detection is
   * not so complex. However, it can be time-consuming because we
   * need to split the 3D triangles into three 2D triangles each for
   * collision detection.
